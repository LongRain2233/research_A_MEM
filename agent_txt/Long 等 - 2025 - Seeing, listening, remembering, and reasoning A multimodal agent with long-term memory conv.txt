Abstract

We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and auditory inputs to build and update episodic and semantic memories, gradually accumulating world knowledge. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal manner, enabling deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment. Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn reasoning and retrieves relevant memories to complete tasks. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal agents, we develop M3-Bench, a long-video question answering benchmark comprising 100 newly recorded robot-perspective videos (M3-Bench-robot) and 920 diverse web-sourced videos (M3-Bench-web). We annotate QA pairs designed to test capabilities essential for agent applications, such as person understanding, general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning.   Experimental results show that M3-Agent,  trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o,  achieving 6.7%,  7.7%,  and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot,  M3-Bench-web  and VideoMME-long, respectively.  Our work advances multimodal agents toward more human-like long-term memory and provides insights for their practical design.

Multimodal agents continuously perceive their environment, build entity-centric, multimodal long-term memories, and reason over them.

1	Introduction

Imagine that in the future a household robot can autonomously carry out household tasks without your explicit instructions; it must have learned the operational rules of your home through daily experiences. In the morning, it hands you a cup of coffee without asking “coffee or tea?", because it has gradually formed a memory of you, tracking your preferences and routines through long-term interactions.  For a multimodal agent, achieving this level of intelligence fundamentally relies on three capabilities: (1) continuously perceiving the world via multimodal sensors; (2) storing and organizing its experiences into a long-term memory, and gradually building knowledge of its environment; (3) reasoning over this accumulated memory to guide its actions.

To achieve the goals, we propose M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with long-term memory. As shown in Figure 1, it operates through two parallel processes: memorization, which continuously perceives real-time multimodal inputs to construct and update long-term memory; and control, which interprets external instructions, reasons over the stored memory, and executes the corresponding tasks.
During memorization, M3-Agent processes the incoming video stream, capturing both fine-grained details and high-level abstractions by generating two types of memory, analogous to human cognitive systems [44, 45]:

•  Episodic memory: Concrete events observed within the video. For example, "Alice takes the coffee and says, ‘I can’t go without this in the morning,’" and "Alice throws an empty bottle into the green garbage bin."
•  Semantic memory: General knowledge from the clip. For example, "Alice prefers to drink coffee in the morning" and "The green garbage bin is used for recycling."

The generated contents are then integrated into the agent’s long-term memory, which supports multimodal information such as faces, voices, and textual knowledge.  The memory is organized in an entity-centric structure.   For example,  information related to the same person (e.g.,  their face,  voice,  and associated knowledge) is connected within a graph, as shown in Figure 1. These connections are incrementally established as the agent extracts and integrates episodic and semantic memory.

Figure 1   Architecture of M3-Agent, comprising a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a multimodal long-term memory.  The system consists of two parallel processes:  memorization and control.  During memorization, M3-Agent processes video and audio streams online to generate episodic and semantic memory.   During control, it executes instructions by iteratively reasoning and retrieving from long-term memory.  The long-term memory is structured as a multimodal graph.

During control, M3-Agent leverages its long-term memory to reason and complete tasks. It autonomously retrieves relevant information from its long-term memory across different dimensions,  such as events or characters. Instead of using single-turn retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to load memory into context [22], M3-Agent employs reinforcement learning to enable multi-turn reasoning and iterative memory retrieval, resulting in higher task success rates.
The memorization task relates to long video description [13, 18, 57] but goes beyond it, introducing two key challenges: (1) Infinite information processing. Memorization requires handling infinitely long input streams. Existing methods optimize architectural eficiency to process longer, but still finite, ofline videos [14, 40– 42, 58].  In contrast, M3-Agent continuously processes arbitrarily long multimodal streams online, more closely mimicking how human long-term memory forms, through ongoing perception and incremental experience integration. (2) World knowledge construction. Traditional video description [1, 24, 26, 27, 55] often focuses on low-level visual details while overlooking high-level world knowledge [12, 19, 36] such as character identity and entity attributes, which may lead to ambiguity and inconsistency in long-term contexts.  M3-Agent addresses this by incrementally building world knowledge through an entity-centric memory structure.  It forms rich, multimodal representations of key entities, enabling coherent and consistent long-term memory.

We evaluate M3-Agent on long video question answering (LVQA), where the videos simulate the multimodal input streams (visual and auditory) received by an agent. Most existing LVQA benchmarks [2, 11, 50, 62] mainly focus on visual understanding, such as action recognition and spatial/temporal perception, leaving a gap in evaluating higher-level cognitive abilities that rely on long-term memory and are crucial for real-world agents, such as understanding persons, extracting general knowledge, and performing cross-modal reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce M3-Bench, a new LVQA benchmark designed to evaluate a multimodal agent’s ability to reason with long-term memory. M3-Bench consists videos from two sources: (1) M3-Bench-robot, consisting of 100 real-world videos recorded from a robot’s perspective, and (2) M3-Bench-web, comprising 920 YouTube videos spanning a broader range of content and scenarios.  We define five question types, as shown in Table 1, targeting different aspects of memory-based reasoning.  In total, we annotate 1,276 QA pairs for M3-Bench-robot and 3,214 QA pairs for M3-Bench-web.
We conduct experiments on the M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web, and VideoMME-long [11]. Results show that M3-Agent trained via reinforcement learning outperforms all baselines on all three benchmarks. Compared to the strongest baseline, Gemini-GPT4o-Hybrid, which implements M3-Agent framework by prompting Gemini-1.5-Pro [43] for memorization and GPT-4o [17] for control, M3-Agent improves accuracy by 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web, and VideoMME-long, respectively.  Our ablation study demonstrates the importance of semantic memory: removing it reduces accuracy by 17.1%, 19.2% and 13.1% on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web, and VideoMME-long, respectively. Furthermore, we examine the impact of RL training, inter-turn instructions, and reasoning mode on control performance. Specifically, RL training improves accuracy by 10.0%, 8.0%, and 9.3% on the respective benchmarks. Removing inter-turn instruction results in a 10.5%, 5.8% and 5.9% decrease in accuracy, while disabling reasoning mode leads to accuracy declines of 11.7%, 8.8% and 9.5% on the three benchmarks.

The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
• We introduce M3-Agent, a novel framework for multimodal agents with long-term memory. M3-Agent continuously processes real-time multimodal inputs (seeing and listening), incrementally builds world knowledge by generating both episodic and semantic memories (remembering), and performs reasoning over these memories to complete complex instructions (reasoning).

• We develop M3-Bench, a new LVQA benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness of memory and memory-based reasoning for multimodal agents.

•  Our experiments demonstrate that M3-Agent, trained by reinforcement learning, consistently outperforms agents based on prompted commercial models across multiple benchmarks.

2.1	Long-Term Memory of AI Agents
Long-term memory is essential for AI agents [10], enabling them to retain distant contextual information and support more advanced reasoning. A common approach is to append entire agent trajectories, such as dialogues [29, 33, 46, 61] or execution trajectories [16, 29, 31, 37, 38, 48], directly to memory.  Beyond raw data, some methods incorporate summaries [16, 23, 46, 61], latent embeddings [6, 30, 42, 58], or structured knowledge representations [35, 52].  Recent systems further construct sophisticated memory architectures, giving agents finer control on memory management [5, 20, 46].
However, most existing approaches focus on LLM agents. In contrast, multimodal agents process a broader range of inputs and store richer, multimodal content and concepts in memory [7, 8]. This also introduces new challenges, particularly in maintaining consistency of long-term memory. Moreover, just as humans acquire world knowledge through experience, multimodal agents should form internal world knowledge in memory, rather than merely storing description of experience.

2.2	Online Video Understanding
For multimodal agent, memory formation is closely related to online video understanding, a challenging task requires real-time processing of video streams and decision-making based on past observations. Traditional approaches to long video understanding, such as extending the context window in multimodal models [4, 60] or compressing visual tokens to increase temporal coverage [21, 49, 49], do not scale effectively for infinitely long video streams.  In practical settings, such as interactive agent scenarios, reprocessing the entire video history for each new instruction is computationally prohibitive.
To improve scalability, memory-based methods [14, 42, 58, 59] introduce memory modules that store encoded visual features for future retrieval. These architectures are suited for online video processing. However, they face a fundamental limitation: maintaining long-term consistency. Because they store only visual features, these methods struggle to maintain coherent tracking of entities such as human identities or evolving events over time.

With the rapid advancement of large multimodal and language models [1, 17, 43, 53, 55], the Socratic Models framework [28, 56, 57] has emerged as a promising approach for online video understanding. By leveraging multimodal models to generate video descriptions as language-based memory, this method improves scalability. Nevertheless, it still encounters challenges in maintaining long-term consistency across complex, evolving video content.

3	Datasets

In this section, we introduce M3-Bench, an LVQA dataset designed to evaluate the capability of multimodal agents to perform reasoning over long-term memory.  Each instance in M3-Bench comprises a long video simulating the perceptual input of an agent, along with a series of open-ended question-answer pairs. The dataset is organized into two subsets: (1) M3-Bench-robot, which contains 100 real-world videos recorded from a robot’s first-person perspective, and (2) M3-Bench-web, which includes 920 web-sourced videos covering a wider variety of content and scenarios.  To comprehensively assess an agent’s ability to recall past observations and perform memory-based reasoning, we curate five distinct types of questions, as summarized in Table 1. Overall, M3-Bench is featured by (1) long-duration, real-world videos that encompass diverse real-life scenarios relevant to the deployment of multimodal agents, and (2) challenging questions that extend beyond shallow perceptual understanding and require complex reasoning over long-term contexts.

Figure 2 presents examples from M3-Bench. The overall statistics of M3-Bench is shown in Figure 3. Table 2 provides a comparative analysis with existing LVQA benchmarks. The remainder of this section elaborates on the data collection and annotation procedures for M3-Bench-robot and M3-Bench-web, respectively.

Figure 2  Examples from M3-Bench.  M3-Bench-robot features long videos from realistic robotic work scenarios, while M3-Bench-web expands the video diversity to support broader evaluation.  The question-answering tasks are designed to assess a multimodal agent’s ability to construct consistent and reliable long-term memory, as well as to reason effectively over that memory.


3.1	M3-Bench-robot
Robots are representative examples of multimodal agents. A general-purpose robot should be able to maintain long-term memory and reason with it to guide its actions.  For example, as it processes observations, the robot may remember a person’s name, where they left their coat, or their coffee preference.   Reasoning over long-term memory enables higher-level cognitive functions, such as inferring a person’s personality, understanding relationships among individuals,  or identifying the functions of surrounding objects.   To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we record a new collection of videos from robot’s perspective and manually annotate corresponding question-answer pairs.
Scripts Design  We begin by designing video scripts for M3-Bench-robot across seven everyday scenarios where robots are expected to operate: living room, kitchen, bedroom, study, ofice, meeting room, and gym. Each script involves one robot interacting with two to four humans.  Annotators are instructed to design human–robot interactions that reflect the desirable capabilities of general-purpose service robots.

To ensure diversity in the script content, we introduce multiple thematic variations for each scenario.  For example, the living room scenario may include themes such as meeting friends, engaging in family conversations, or hosting a Thanksgiving party. Annotators write one script for each theme, thereby ensuring broad coverage and high variability across scripts. Specifically, each script is structured as a sequence of discrete events and questions. Some events are designed as reference events, containing information relevant to a future question. Questions may appear after any event or at the end of the script. When appearing within the event sequence, questions are typically closely tied to the current plot; moving them can alter their answers or affect dificulty. An example script is provided in Table 8 (§ A.5).

General Knowl-edge Extraction

Explanation and Example
This requires aggregating multiple pieces of information distributed across the video. Example:  Which collection has the highest starting price among the five items shown in the video?  The agent must identify and recall the starting price from five distinct segments, then compare these recalled prices to determine the highest.
This involves step-by-step reasoning across different segments to reach a conclusion. Example: Which bubble tea shop did they visit after going to Ding Cha?  The agent must first locate the visit to Ding Cha, then follow subsequent segments to identify the next bubble tea shop.
This requires reasoning across multiple modalities, such as visual and audio content. Example: (Bob shows Robot a red folder and says, "The confidential documents should go in this folder," then shows a white folder and says, "The normal documents should go in this one.") Which folder should confidential documents be placed in?  The agent must combine visual cues (folder color) with dialogues to infer the correct answer.
This  involves  reasoning  about  person-related  attributes  such  as  identity,  emotions, personality, or relationships.
Example: Is Lucas skilled at cooking?  The video does not directly reveal the answer, but the agent must aggregate Lucas’s behavior across multiple cooking scenes to infer his skill level.
This evaluates whether the agent can extract general knowledge from specific events. Example: (A person is shown classifying different groceries into various shelves of a refrigerator) Which shelf is suitable for storing vegetables?  The agent must recognize typical storage rules from its observation to answer correctly.


Table 1  Explanations of different question types and their corresponding examples in M3-Bench.


To ensure the complexity of video content and the quality of downstream video filming and annotation, annotators must meet the following criteria:
•  Annotate at least 15 questions, each labeled with the reference events required to answer them. •  Ensure each question is assigned to at least one type listed in Table 1.
•  Each script must contain at least 70 events to ensure a minimum video duration of 30 minutes.
Video Filming Recording videos with actual robots poses significant challenges due to high operational costs, hardware limitations,  and deployment complexities.   To address these constraints,  we adopt a practical alternative: employing human actors to simulate robot behavior. This approach simplifies data collection while preserving both the first-person robot perspective and the multimodal quality required for our benchmark.

Each script involves multiple actors, with one designated to simulate the robot. This actor wears head-mounted camera equipment to capture the robot’s egocentric visual and auditory perspective. The resulting footage constitute the final videos in M3-Bench-robot. To ensure diversity and minimize location bias, we recruit 67 actors and film across 51 distinct locations, with no more than three videos recorded at each location.
We collect two types of audio tracks for each video.  The first is directly recorded by the head-mounted device, reflecting the raw auditory input a robot would naturally receive, including ambient sounds and spatial acoustic variations. The second is captured using individual lapel microphones worn by each actor, providing high-fidelity voice recordings to complement the primary audio stream.

Annotations After recording the videos, annotators curate QA pairs for each video. Although some questions are pre-scripted, the final video content may deviate from the original script due to realistic filming conditions. Consequently, not all scripted questions remain applicable. Annotators carefully review each scripted question to determine whether it should be retained, revised, or discarded, and provide corresponding answers when

necessary. For all retained or revised questions, annotators are required to specify the precise timestamp at which the question should be asked.  Importantly, the timestamp must precede the robot’s corresponding response or action to avoid inadvertently revealing the answer.
In addition to the script-based questions, annotators are also required to create new questions to ensure that each video contains at least 12 QA pairs. All newly added questions should also align with one or more of the question types listed in Table 1.

Besides QA pair creation, annotators also generate subtitles to enhance the usability of the dataset. Specifically, they manually annotate the start and end timestamps for each dialogue segment, together with the speaker’s identity and the transcribed dialogue content.
Full annotation guidelines, annotators information and quality control details for M3-Bench-robot annotation are presented in Appendix A.

3.2	M3-Bench-web
To further increase video diversity, we collect extra videos from YouTube following existing practice [9, 11, 34].
Video Collection The video collection adopts a question-driven approach: annotators select videos that could support the design of at least five questions belong to the types listed in Table 1. This strategy naturally leads to the selection of videos with rich narratives and complex inter-entity relationships, making them well-suited for assessing agent’s capability of reasoning with long-term memory.

To promote video diversity and avoid overrepresentation of easily annotated content, we provide annotators

with a reference list of video categories emphasizing high information density and relevance to real-world multimodal agent applications. Annotators are required to submit up to 20 videos from each category and are allowed to suggest new categories, which are included if deemed suficiently distinct from the existing category list by the authors. The final dataset comprises 46 distinct video types, as summarized in Figure 3.
QA Annotations The same annotator who collects the video also generates at least five corresponding question-answer pairs. Each question must correspond to at least one type defined in Table 1. In M3-Bench-web, all question timestamps are set to the end of the video. All questions are required to be specific, objective, and have a single unambiguous answer that can be reasonably derived from clues in the video, ensuring both the effectiveness and fairness of subsequent evaluation.  For example, questions answerable from multiple perspectives or with ambiguous references, such as "the man" or "in the middle part of the video," are not considered valid. Appendix B provides the full annotation guidelines, annotators’ information, and quality control details for M3-Bench-web.

3.3	Automatic Evaluation
We use GPT-4o as an automatic evaluator for M3-Bench by prompting it to assess the correctness of a generated answer by comparing it to the corresponding reference answer for the same question. The prompt template is shown in Table 18 (§ H.1).

To validate GPT-4o as a reliable judge, we construct a test set of 100 randomly sampled triples, each consisting of a question, its reference answer, and a generated answer from our method or various baselines (§ 5.1). Three authors independently evaluate the correctness of each generated answer, and GPT-4o’s judgments are compared with the majority vote of human annotations. GPT-4o achieves 96% agreement with human judges, confirming its effectiveness as an automatic evaluator.

4	Approach

As  shown  in  Figure  1,  M3-Agent  consists  of  a  multimodal  LLM  and  a  long-term  memory  module.   It operates through two parallel processes: memorization, which enables continuous processing of arbitrarily long video streams and builds a lifelong memory; and control, which reasons over long-term memory to execute instructions. In the following subsections, we detail long-term memory storage, memorization, and control, respectively.

Return top-k most relevant memory clips for the given query. A memory clip refers to the agent’s episodic and semantic memory of a segment (typically 30 seconds) generated during clip-by-clip streaming video processing.


Table 4  Search functions supported by long-term memory.


connected by undirected edges that represent logical relationships between memory items. For example, items sharing the same entity ID are linked to form an entity-centric memory graph. This design supports not only sequential retrieval of memories based on timestamps but also associative retrieval based on entities.
The agent constructs its memory by incrementally adding new text, image, or audio nodes. When a memory generated by the memorization process already exists in long-term memory,  the corresponding node or edge is reactivated and its weight increased;  if it is new,  a corresponding node or edge is added to the graph. Conflicting information may be introduced during construction. To resolve this, M3-Agent applies a weight-based voting mechanism during inference:  frequently activated entries accumulate higher weights and override conflicting entries with lower weights. This mechanism ensures the robustness and consistency of the memory graph over time.

Search Tool To facilitate memory retrieval, we provide a suite of search tools that enable the agent to retrieve relevant memories based on specific requirements. In particular, we implement two types of search mechanisms operating at different levels of granularity, as summarized in Table 4.  Detailed implementation of these retrieval mechanisms is provided in Appendix C.

4.2	Memorization
As shown in Figure 1, during memorization, M3-Agent processes the incoming video stream in clip-by-clip manner, generating two types of memory: episodic memory, which captures visual and auditory content from the raw video; and semantic memory, which extracts general knowledge such as character identities, attributes, relationships, and other world knowledge. Semantic memory not only enriches the memory content, but also provides additional retrieval cues, enhancing retrieval effectiveness for control process.
Consistent Entity Representation A key challenge in constructing high-quality long-term memory is maintaining consistent representations of core concepts—such as main characters and objects—across arbitrarily long time spans. Existing works typically generates language-based descriptions, such as "a man with a beard" or "a woman in a red dress".   However,  such textual descriptions are inherently ambiguous and prone to inconsistencies when accumulated over time.   To address this issue,  M3-Agent preserves the original multimodal features and constructs persistent identity representations within its long-term memory.  This approach provides a more stable and robust foundation ensuring consistency over time.

Specifically,  we equip M3-Agent with a suite of external tools,  including facial recognition and speaker identification. These tools extract the faces and voices of characters appearing in the clip and return their corresponding identities from the long-term memory.  Each extracted face or voice is associated with an existing node by using search_node function or assigned to a newly created node. The resulting identifiers (face_id  or  voice_id)  serve  as  persistent  references  to  the  corresponding  characters.   By  leveraging  the globally maintained memory graph as a unifying structure, M3-Agent ensures consistent character identity mapping across local memories from different clips, thereby forming a coherent long-term memory.

This approach can be generalized to encode more concepts, such as key locations or objects, into long-term memory, thereby further improving the consistency of memory generation. Detailed implementations of both tools are provided in Appendix C.

Memory Generation  Having the face and voice identities, M3-Agent continues to generate both episodic and semantic memory.  Each character must be referenced by their face_id or voice_id.  For example: "<face_1>  wears  a  red  hat  and  blue  top,"  or  "<voice_2>  speaks  to  <face_3>,  ‘How  are  you  doing  today?’" This mechanism ensures that each character is unambiguously grounded with physical features stored in long-term memory.  Specially, in semantic memory, M3-Agent can perform cross-modal reasoning to infer relationships between different entity IDs (e.g., linking a face and a voice belonging to the same person). These inferred equivalences can then be used to update the connections between face and voice nodes in the memory graph. Once linked, the pair is treated as a single character. During retrieval, connected nodes are unified under a shared <character_id>, enabling the model to reason about characters more consistently across modalities.
With respect to the output format, M3-Agent generates both episodic and semantic memory as a list of text entries.  Each entry is stored in the memory graph as a text node, except for entity ID relationships represented as edges. As described in the memory storage, conflicting information is resolved through a voting mechanism.  For example, <voice_3> corresponds to <face_0>, but in some challenging clips, the system might temporarily link it to a different face. Over time, as correct associations accumulate, the weight of the correct mapping (<voice_3>, <face_0>) increases and dominates. This allows the system to robustly learn and maintain accurate knowledge, even in the presence of occasional local errors.

4.3	Control
When an instruction is received, the control process is triggered. As illustrated in Figure 1, during control, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn reasoning and invokes search functions to retrieve relevant memories. Unlike traditional single-turn RAG, this iterative approach enables more complex planning, making the system more flexible and more capable. Specifically, the control process follows Algorithm 1, with prompts in Table 22 (§ H.3). Here πθ  is the control policy, q is user question, and D is the long-term memory. At each round, πθ  generates a response consisting of reasoning, an action, and associated argument. If the action is [Search], the system queries D with the argument and appends retrieved results to the context for the next round. Depending on the context, it can call different search functions to retrieve memories from multiple perspective (e.g., search_node for people or search_clip for events). If the action is [Answer], the system returns the content and the process terminates. This loop continues for up to H rounds.

4.4	Training
We apply reinforcement learning to optimize the M3-Agent.  Although the memorization and control are conceptually handled by a single model, we trained two separate policy models to achieve optimal performance. Memorization relies strong multimodal understanding, while control requires strong reasoning capabilities. Accordingly,  we  initialized  each  policy  model  with  different  foundation  models:   Qwen2.5-Omni  [51],  an advanced open-source multimodal model supporting both visual and audio inputs, for memorization; and Qwen3 [53], an open-source large language model with powerful reasoning abilities, for control.

The training data are sourced from our in-house video dataset, which we have permissions for model training. We collect videos along with corresponding question-answer pairs, adhering to the same annotation standards used in the M3-Bench-web dataset. In total, the training dataset comprises 500 long videos, corresponding to 26,943 30-second clips, and 2,736 question-answer pairs.
Memorization To improve the model’s ability to generate desired memory, we perform imitation learning on Qwen2.5-Omni-7b to create memory-7b-sft. The process begins with constructing a high-quality synthetic demonstration dataset. We segment each video in the dataset into 30-second clips, and corresponding memory annotations are generated through a three-stage process:  (1) Episodic memory synthesis:  We perform a hybrid annotation strategy by jointly prompting Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o. Accordingly, GPT-4o supplies frame-level cues, which serve as priors for Gemini-1.5-Pro; the two outputs are merged to form richer narrative summaries than either alone. (2) Identity equivalence detection: We propose an algorithm that automatically mines high-confidence meta-clips, short monologue clips containing exactly one face and one voice, from a long video to construct a global face-voice correspondence. These meta-clips offer clear identity cues, enabling accurate face-voice pairing. Once the global mapping is established, it can be used to automatically annotate

(3) Other semantic memory synthesis: We design prompt templates to extract semantic memories from various perspectives, guiding semantic memories to include information listed in Table 10 (§ D). Details of the data synthesis process are provided in Appendix D. In total, we synthesize 10,952 samples: 10,752 for training and 200 for validation.
Fine-tuning is conducted for 3 epochs with a learning rate of 1e − 5 and batch size of 16, using 16 GPUs with 80GB memory.

Control We first set up the environment for RL training.  For each video in the dataset, we generate the corresponding long-term memory using memory-7b-sft.  For any given question, the agent is restricted to searching within the memory generated from the video associated with that question.

We then train the policy model πθ  using DAPO [54], which initialized from control-32b-prompt. For each question-answer pair (q,a) sampled from training dataset D, the policy πθ  rollouts a group of G trajectories

τi=1, using the algorithm shown in Algorithm 1.  For each trajectory τi, the final submitted answer yi  is
extracted and evaluated using the GPT-4o evaluator introduced in Section 3.3.   The reward of the i-th
trajectory is given by:	(

Then, the advantage of the i-th response is calculated by normalizing the group-level rewards {Ri}i=1:

5	Experiments

5.1	Baselines
We evaluate M3-Agent against three types of baselines:
Socratic Models This baseline adapts the Socratic Models framework [56], which uses a multimodal model to describe 30-second video clips. These descriptions are stored as long-term memory. To answer a question, an LLM performs retrieval augmented generation (RAG) [22]: It first invokes a search_clip function to retrieve memory relevant to the question, and then generates a response based on the retrieved content.

We implement both closed-source and open-source multimodal models for memory generation: •  Gemini-1.5-Pro [43]: Takes the full 30-second video clip as input.
•  GPT-4o [17]:  Since it does not process audio, we provide video frames sampled at 0.5 fps and ASR transcripts.
•  Qwen2.5-Omni-7b [51]:  An advanced open-source multimodal model that supports both visual and audio inputs. It receives the full video as input.

•  Qwen2.5-VL-7b [1]: An open-source vision-language models with SOTA results in visual-language tasks. Like GPT-4o, it receives both video frames (sampled at 0.5 fps) and ASR transcripts.
For all variants, GPT-4o serves as the LLM for RAG-based question answering. We apply extensive prompt engineering to optimize performance for each setup. All prompts are provided in Appendix H.2.

Online Video Understanding Methods We further compare our approach with three online video understanding frameworks: MovieChat [42], MA-LMM [14], and Flash-VStream [58]. Unless otherwise specified, we adopt their oficial pretrained weights and default configurations.
•  MovieChat [42]: It uses a sliding-window to extract frame-level features and stores them in a hybrid memory; the LLM performs QA conditioned on this memory.

•  MA-LMM [14]: It processes frames in an online manner, consisting of feature extraction (1 fps), temporal modeling (100-frame input), and LLM decoding.
•  Flash-VStream [58]: It adopts a two-stage asynchronous pipeline: stream video frame compression (1 fps), and LLM-based QA over the compressed features.

Agent Methods We also compare M3-Agent with agents implemented via prompting closed-source commercial models. Specifically, we consider the following two baselines:

•  Gemini-Agent: Gemini-1.5-Pro is prompted separately for memorization and control process. During memorization, it receives the full video with audio, facial recognition results and speaker identification results to generate episodic and semantic memories, denoted as memory-gemini-prompt. In the control, it performs memory searches and generates responses, referred to as control-gemini-prompt.
•  Gemini-GPT4o-Hybrid:  We also evaluate a setup where GPT-4o is prompted to perform memory search  and  generate  responses  (control-gpt4o-prompt).    The  memorization  remains  handled  by memory-gemini-prompt.



12


The prompts are provided in Appendix H.3.
We set the maximum number of execution rounds H to 5 for M3-Agent and all agent-based baselines.  In the implementation of search_clip, the top 2 most relevant memory clips (i.e., k = 2) are returned if any relevant clips are found. If none of such clips can be found, the method returns an empty result.

5.2	Dataset and Evaluation
We evaluate M3-Agent and all baselines on both M3-Bench-robot and M3-Bench-web. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we also test M3-Agent on a long-video understanding benchmark, VideoMME-long [11], following its oficial evaluation protocol1.

Table 5   Results on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web, and VideoMME-long.  We also present a comparison of all methods across different question types in M3-Bench:  multi-evidence reasoning (ME), multi-hop reasoning (MH), cross-modal reasoning (CM), person understanding (PU), and general knowledge extraction (GK).

As shown in Table 5, M3-Agent outperforms all baselines on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web, and VideoMME-long. Specifically, on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Agent achieves a 6.3% accuracy improvement over the strongest baseline, MA-LLM. On M3-Bench-web and VideoMME-long, it surpasses the strongest baseline, Gemini-GPT4o-Hybrid, by 7.7% and 5.3%, respectively.
We further evaluate M3-Agent against all baselines across different question types in M3-Bench. M3-Agent shows strong performance in human understanding and cross-modal reasoning.  Specifically, compared to the best-performing baseline on M3-Bench-robot, MA-LMM, M3-Agent achieves improvements of 4.2% in human understanding and 8.5% in cross-modal reasoning. On M3-Bench-web, M3-Agent outperforms the top baseline, Gemini-GPT4o-Hybrid, with gains of 15.5% and 6.7% in the respective categories. These results demonstrate M3-Agent ’s superior ability to maintain character consistency, deepen human understanding, and effectively integrate multimodal information.

We also assess the memorization model via precision and comprehension, as reported in Appendix E.

5.4	Ablation Study
To evaluate the impact of memorization on overall performance, we fixed the control model to control-7b-rl and compared different memorization methods, as shown in Table 6.  First, we replaced the memory with

This suggests that memory-7b-sft produces higher-quality memory than memory-gemini-prompt.   Next, we evaluated memory-7b-prompt, which led to accuracy reductions of 5.4%, 9.0%, and 11.0% on the same benchmarks, highlighting the importance of imitation learning in generating effective memory.  Finally, we ablated key components in the memory generation process.   The results show that removing character identity equivalence or semantic memory significantly degrades QA performance.

The memorization model is fixed as memory-7b-sft.

Next, we investigate the impact of control on final performance. We fix memorization model as memory-7b-sft and evaluate various control models, as shown in Table 7.  First, we compare two RL algorithms:  GRPO and DAPO. Training details for GRPO are provided in Appendix F. Our results show that control-32b-rl trained with DAPO consistently outperform control-32b-grpo across all test sets.  Second, we analyze how DAPO’s performance scales with model size. The results indicate substantial improvements across all sizes. Specifically, after DAPO training, control-32b-rl achieves improvements of 10.0%, 8.0%, and 9.3% in accuracy over control-32b-prompt on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web, and VideoMME-long, respectively. Finally, we ablate two designs:  inter-instruction and reasoning.  Both are shown to be critical.  Removing inter-instruction results in accuracy drops of 10.5%, 5.8%, and 5.9% on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web, and VideoMME-long, respectively.  Removing reasoning leads to decreases of 11.7%, 8.8%, and 9.5% on the same benchmarks.

5.5	Case Study
Memorization  Table 15, 16 (§ G) present two examples illustrating the episodic and semantic memories generated  during  memory  access.    Compared  to  memory-gemini-prompt,  memory-7b-sft  demonstrates (1)  more  detailed  episodic  memory  generation,  including  richer  scene  descriptions,  character  actions  and expressions, and dialogue; (2) improved recognition of identity equivalence, enabling consistent long-term tacking of human identities; and (3) richer semantic memory extraction, proactively generating knowledge

about characters and environments.
Control To illustrate the control process in detail, Table 17 (§ G) presents a complete generation trajectory of control-32b-rl. The input question is: "Is Tomasz a person with rich imagination or someone who lacks imagination?"

In the first round, the agent searches its memory for Tomasz’s character ID. In the second round, having iden-tified Tomasz as <character_4>, it attempts a direct query: "What is <character_4>’s personality regarding imagination?" Finding no relevant memory in the third round, the agent reasons based on <character_4>’s role as CTO of a company and generates a more targeted query: "What are <character_4>’s creative problem-solving methods?" This yields a relevant memory: "<character_4> is innovative and forward-thinking, as evidenced by his interest in scaling drone technology for personal flight."—a piece of semantic memory. By the fourth round, the agent has collected enough information in its context to generate the final answer.
Hard Case in M3-Bench The accuracy of various methods demonstrates that M3-Bench, particularly M3-Bench-robot, presents a significant challenge. We perform a detailed error analysis of M3-Agent on M3-Bench, identifying two representative hard cases and their associated challenges that demand further investigation.

The first category involves reasoning about fine-grained details. For instance, questions like "Who wants to eat the ham sausage?" or "Which coat rack should Emma’s hat be laced, taller one or shorter one?" require the agent to extract precise information from its observations. However, retaining all such details in memory is impractical and may cause cognitive overload. To address this, the agent must use attention mechanisms that enables selective memorization. During execution, it can develop task-specific world knowledge, allowing it to focus on relevant details while ignoring the irrelevant, thereby improving task performance.
Another category of hard cases is related to spatial reasoning. In the M3-Bench-robot, a number of questions challenge the agent’s capability on spatial cognition, such as understanding spatial layout and tracking spatial changes. Examples include: "Where can the robot get the snacks?" and "Is Leo’s water cup currently on the second or third shelf from the top of the rack?" Since verbal memory is generally less effective than visual memory for retaining spatial information, the long-term memory should be designed to incorporate richer visual content, e.g., snapshots, to better support spatial reasoning.

6	Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we introduce M3-Agent, a multimodal agent framework equipped with long-term memory. M3-Agent perceives real-time video and audio streams to build both episodic and semantic memories, enabling it to accumulate world knowledge and maintain consistent, context-rich memory over time. When responding to instruction, M3-Agent can autonomously reason and retrieve relevant information from memory to complete tasks more effectively.  To evaluate memory effectiveness and reasoning, we develop M3-Bench, a LVQA benchmark featuring real-world, robot-perspective videos in practical environments, and challenging questions revolving human understanding, knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning, also closely reflecting real-world demands.  We evaluate our method against various baselines, including Socratic models, online video understanding methods, and M3-Agent implemented by prompting closed-source models.  Experimental results on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web and VideoMME-long show that M3-Agent consistently outperforms all baselines, demonstrating its superior memorization and reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, by conducting detailed case studies, we identify key limitations that point to promising future directions. These including enhancing attention mechanisms for semantic memory formation and developing richer yet more eficient visual memory.

A	M3-Bench-robot

A.1	Script Annotation Guidelines

Actor Setup

Four to five actors participate, including one playing the role of robot. The robot actor wears a head-mounted camera, either an iPhone 16 Pro, Xiaomi 14 Ultra, or GoPro HERO13, to capture a single point-of-view video from the robot’s perspective.

Definitions

1. Script: Consists of events and questions and provides actors with dialogue and stage instructions.
2. Robot: Played by a human actor. It is an ideal highly intelligent robot with reasoning and memory abilities similar to humans.

3. Scenario: living room, kitchen, bedroom, study, ofice, meeting room, and gym.
4. Event: A complete, short plot within the script. A reference event includes information relevant to future questions, such as robots interacting with humans while observing and learning human preferences or the placement of objects in real-world scenes.

5. Question: Designed to evaluate the robot’s memory. Each question must align with at least one type listed in Table 1.

Requirements

•  Annotate at least 15 questions, each labeled with the corresponding reference events.
•  Each script must contain at least 70 events to ensure a minimum video duration of 30 minutes.
•  Avoid asking questions that rely solely on common sense or that can be answered without watching the video.

•  Do not ask questions that remain unanswerable even after watching the video. •  Avoid questions that can be answered based solely on the dialogue.
•  Do no include questions that are weakly related to the reference events.
•  The question should have a clear and unambiguous answer that can be objectively verified by comparing it to the reference answer.

A.2	QA Annotation Guidelines

Background

•  In the future, robots will help humans complete many tasks in indoor environments such as homes. Based on this imagination, we filmed a video from the perspective of a robot.
•  In order to evaluate the model’s ability, we set questions at different timestamps, typically related to the robot’s upcoming tasks. Correct answers are essential for the successful completion of these tasks.

•  Some questions require manual review or additional annotations to ensure each video includes at least 10 questions.

Task

Provide a 30–45 minute video along with a corresponding script that includes a series of questions.  Note: Minor script modifications may occur during filming to accommodate practical constraints. As a result, the script may not perfectly align with the final video.
1. Review existing questions. For each question in the script:

21


•  Annotate the corresponding timestamp in the video based on the related script event.
•  Determine whether the question can be answered using the video content up to that point.   If so, annotate the answer.

•  If the question is unanswerable, consider whether modifying it could make it answerable. If applicable, revise the question and provide the answer.
•  For each question-answer pair, annotate the reasoning process used to derive the answer and specify the question types according to Table 1.

2. Annotate additional questions:
If fewer than 10 questions remain after reviewing the script, generate new questions that must belong to at least one type listed in Table 1.

A.3	Quality Control
The annotation process consists of two rounds. In the first round, the goal is to ensure that annotators fully understand the annotation guidelines. Each annotator is required to perform QA annotations on three videos. The authors then review the annotations, provide feedback, and the annotators may revise their annotation accordingly. Based on the quality of these initial annotations, the authors determine whether the annotator is qualified to proceed to the formal annotation phase. In the second round, each annotator annotates five videos at a time.  The authors randomly select one video from each batch for quality inspection.  If more than one invalid question-answer is found in the selected video, the entire batch must be re-annotated. Otherwise, the batch is considered accepted.  Two authors are involved in the quality control process throughout the annotation workflow.
In addition, to ensure the quality of the questions in M3-Bench-robot, we recruited five annotators to answer each question. Annotators were allowed to first read the question and then watch the video as many times as needed. The final human accuracy on M3-Bench-robot is 90.7%. Our error analysis shows that the most common mistakes are counting-related problems.

A.4	Annotator Information
All annotators are employed by a commercial data annotation company. We sign a contract with the company and pay the company for the annotation work at a market price. The annotators are all college graduates with strong English proficiency.  For script annotation, eleven annotators are involved.  Video filming engage 67 actors. For QA annotation, five annotators participate.

A.5	Data Examples
Table 8 provides an example of script annotation.

B.1	Annotation Guidelines
To better help the annotators understand the requirements and better ensure the overall quality, safety, and validity of the datasets, we provide the following detailed guidelines, which clearly specify the acceptable and unacceptable annotation practices.
•  Questions must allow for verifiable and objective evaluation of correctness. This entails avoiding overly open-ended questions, compound questions that mix multiple sub-questions, or questions with multiple equally valid answers.

•  Each  video  must  include  at  least  two  questions  targeting  character  attribute  modeling  and  two questions involving commonsense reasoning.

•  All  visual  information  required  to  answer  a  question  must  remain  clearly  recognizable  at  lower resolutions (≤720p), ensuring that all questions are answerable.
•  For videos between 20 and 40 minutes in length, 5 questions should be generated; for videos exceeding 40 minutes, 10 questions should be provided. Compensation considers both the number and duration of the videos.

•  For commonsense reasoning questions, annotators must also specify the commonsense knowledge being tested, in addition to the question and its answer.
•  It is not permissible for all questions to be answerable using only audio.  A reasonable proportion of questions must be vision-centric, requiring understanding of visual content in the video.

•  Redundant questions within the same video are not allowed. For instance, asking "Describe David’s appearance" and "Describe Alice’s appearance" would be considered repetitive.
•  Questions that can be answered solely based on a brief moment or a short clip should be avoided. Specifically, the context required to answer a valid question should span more than 10 seconds of video content.

23


•  Videos must not contain sensitive, offensive, or NSFW content.
•  Avoid asking questions that rely solely on commonsense knowledge and do not require viewing the video. Such questions do not meaningfully test video understanding.

•  Avoid questions that are too easy to guess based on social priors or language bias alone. For example, a question like "Did the teacher appear impatient when students repeatedly interrupted the class?" may be too easily answered with "No" due to cultural expectations of teacher behavior, regardless of the actual video content. This undermines the goal of evaluating visual understanding.
•  Do not directly convert characters’ spoken lines into questions.  These are typically answerable via simple string matching or keyword retrieval, which again does not effectively test video comprehension.

•  Balance the number of questions with answer Yes and No.

B.2	Quality Control
The annotation process includes the following quality control stages:
•  Stage 1: Candidate annotators complete a trial task, collecting one video and labeling corresponding QA pairs. The authors review the submission and provide feedback. Once the annotator demonstrates a clear understanding of the annotation guidelines, they proceed to formal annotation.

•  Stage 2:  The annotator submits a batch of 10 videos with corresponding QA pairs.   The authors randomly review 2 of them and provide feedback.  The annotator revise the entire batch accordingly. If the qualified rate of the submitted questions is below 90%, the authors re-sample the revised batch for further inspection. Otherwise, the batch is accepted. Annotators who pass this stage on the first attempt can proceed to Stage 3.
•  Stage 3: The annotator submits a batch of 30 videos with QA pairs. The authors randomly inspect 5 of them and provide feedback. The annotator revises the full batch as needed. If the QA qualified rate is below 90%, a follow-up review of the revised batch is conducted. Otherwise, the batch is accepted.

Two authors are involved in the quality control process.

B.3	Annotator Information
All annotators are from a commercial data annotation company. We have a contract with this company and compensate them at market rates for the annotation work. All annotators are college graduates with strong English proficiency. A total of ten annotators participated in the annotation of M3-Bench-web.

C	Implementation Details of Tools

Here, we provide the implementation details of the tools for representation extraction introduced in Section 4.2.
Facial Recognition To perform facial recognition, we uniformly sample video frames at a rate of 5 frames per second.  For each sampled frame, we employ the buffalo_l predefined model suite from the Insight-Face2  library to extract facial attributes, including bounding box coordinates, identity embeddings, and detection/quality scores.  Low-quality detections—such as those with abnormal aspect ratios or extremely low confidence scores—are discarded. We then apply HDBSCAN clustering on the embeddings of the remaining high-quality faces to group them by character identity.  This yields a set of reliable facial representations, clustered by character.

Voice Identification For speaker identification, we use Gemini-1.5-Pro to extract audio segments corresponding to distinct speaker voices, while simultaneously performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) on each segment. Segments shorter than 2 seconds are filtered out to ensure reliability. We then apply voice embedding model ERes2NetV2[3] to encode each segment into a speaker-specific representation. Based on the resulting voice embeddings, we cluster and merge segments that correspond to the same speaker—i.e., those with similar

vocal characteristics.  This process produces a set of high-quality speaker representations, also grouped by character. The prompt used for voice processing is shown in Table 9.

The Prompt for Voice Processing
You are given a video. Your task is to perform Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and audio diarization on the provided video. Extract all speech segments with accurate timestamps and segment them by speaker turns (i.e., different speakers should have separate segments), but without assigning speaker identifiers.

Return a JSON list where each entry represents a speech segment with the following fields: • start_time: Start timestamp in MM:SS format.
• end_time: End timestamp in MM:SS format. • asr: The transcribed text for that segment.

Example Output: [
"start_time": "00:05", "end_time": "00:08", "asr": "Hello, everyone.", "start_time": "00:09", "end_time": "00:12", "asr": "Welcome to the meeting."
]

Strict Requirements:
• Ensure precise speech segmentation with accurate timestamps.
• Segment based on speaker turns (i.e., different speakers’ utterances should be separated). • Preserve punctuation and capitalization in the ASR output.
• Skip the speeches that can hardly be clearly recognized.
• Return only the valid JSON list (which starts with "[" and ends with "]") without additional explanations.
• If the video contains no speech, return an empty list ("[]").

Now generate the JSON list based on the given video:

Table 9  Prompt used for voice processing.

Search All memory-based retrieval is implemented via Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS), with modality-specific adaptations.

Each face and voice node maintains a set of representative feature snapshots. When new face or voice features are extracted from a video clip, we compute the average cosine similarity between each extracted feature and all stored snapshots per node. The node with the highest similarity exceeding a pre-defined threshold (0.3 for image, 0.6 for voice) is considered a match; otherwise, a new node is created. Matched nodes are updated with the new features to refine their representations over time.
For textual memory, we apply MIPS between the input query and all existing text nodes, using OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-large3  as the embedding model.  To support multi-entry retrieval, we apply a top-k retrieval with a similarity threshold t.  Specifically, we return the k most relevant nodes whose similarities exceed t. To ensure retrieval coherence, we also perform clip-level retrieval: each clip is scored by the highest similarity among its memory entries, and we return the top-ranked clips accordingly. For all experiments, we adopt a relatively strict hyperparameter setting (k = 2, t = 0.5) to reduce retrieval randomness and enable consistent evaluation across models.

D	Demonstration Data Synthesis for Memorization

During memorization, the multimodal model takes inputs including: video, audio, facial identifications (via facial recognition), and voice identities (via voice identification). It generates two outputs, episodic memory

and semantic memory.  To construct training data, we segment training videos into 30-second clips.  For each clip, we then synthesize the corresponding episodic memory, entity identity relationships in semantic memory, and other semantic memory, as detailed below. In total, we synthesize 10,752 training samples for 200 validation samples.


Memory Type

Episodic Memory







Semantic Memory

Explanation
Specific events or experience, capturing not just what happened, but also when, where, and in what context. The episodic memory should captures details such as the people involved, their appearance, actions and spoken words, and the broader environment.
• Character-Identity Equivalence: Captures equivalence relationships across different character modality identity
• Character-Level Attributes:  Extracts attributes for each character, such as name, personality traits (e.g., confident, nervous), role or profession (e.g., host, newcomer), interests, and background information.
•  Interpersonal  Relationships:   Describes  the  relationships  and  interactions  among characters, such as social roles (e.g., host–guest, leader–subordinate), emotional tone (e.g., respect, tension), power dynamics (e.g., who leads), and evidence of cooperation, exclusion, or conflict.
• Contextual and General Knowledge: Encompasses general knowledge inferred from the video, such as likely setting or genre (e.g., corporate meeting, game show), cultural or procedural norms, real-world facts (e.g., "Alice Market is pet-friendly"), common sense, and the functional roles or attributes of objects within the scene.


Table 10  Explanations of different memory types.


D.1	Episodic Memory Synthesis
We employ a hybrid synthetic strategy that integrates the complementary strengths of Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o. Gemini-1.5-Pro supports audio inputs and excels at generating high-level, event-based descriptions, whereas GPT-4o provides more fine-grained visual details.  To leverage both models effectively, we first prompt GPT-4o to generate a detailed visual description of the video using frames sampled at 0.5 fps. This output serves as contextual input for Gemini-1.5-Pro, which is then prompted to generate the final episodic memory. The prompt explicitly instructs Gemini-1.5-Pro to incorporate information from GPT-4o’s description when it deems it accurate. We find that using GPT-4o’s detailed visual output as context significantly enhances the richness of the final memory produced by Gemini-1.5-Pro. The full prompt template is shown in Table 11.

Prompt of Episodic Memory Synthesis (GPT-4o) [Video] includes 16 frames of a video.
Using this information, generate a detailed description of the video. Following the requirements below: 1. Carefully describe the visual elements in each frame, noting colors, objects, movements, environment, people (including actions, clothing, expressions), and any noticeable details or changes between frames. 2. If audio elements or sounds are visible through textual or visual cues within the frames (such as subtitles, audio indicators, or written sound effects), accurately describe these details.
3. Do not speculate or infer information beyond what is explicitly visible in these 16 frames. Avoid using external knowledge or assumptions.
4. Generate only the detailed description based solely on the given frames. Do not produce any additional commentary or explanations.

Prompt of Episodic Memory Synthesis (Gemini-1.5-Pro) You are provided with the following data:
(Continued on next page)

26


[Video]: A video clip in mp4 format.
[Faces]: A list of facial features detected in the video, each linked to a unique face ID (e.g., <face_1>). [Dialogues]: A list of speech segments in the video, including start_time, end_time, speaker ID (e.g., <voice_2>), and the corresponding transcribed text.
[Reference Description]: A description of the video that may contain both accurate and inaccurate details.

Your Tasks:

Based on the video content and reference descriptions, generate a detailed and cohesive description of the video clip. The description should focus on the entire event, incorporating all relevant aspects of the characters, their actions, spoken dialogue, and interactions in a narrative format. The description should include (but is not limited to) the following categories:
• Characters’ Appearance: Describe clothing, physical features, notable accessories, etc.
• Characters’ Actions & Movements: Describe gestures, movement across the scene, or interactions.
• Characters’ Spoken Dialogue: Quote—or, if necessary, summarize—spoken content from the dialogue track.
• Characters’ Contextual Behavior: Describe emotional states, relationships, roles, and reactions. • Environmental or Temporal Cues: Describe the physical setting and time-of-day if visible.

Strict Requirements:
• Incorporate correct elements from the [Reference Description], and correct any mistakes you identify. • Add any additional details visible or inferable from the [Video], [Faces], and [Dialogues] that are missing from the reference.
• Since the given dialogues may be incomplete, reconstruct the entire conversation from the raw audio as precisely as possible.
• If a character has an associated feature ID in the input context (either face or voice), refer to them only using that feature ID (e.g., <face_1>, <voice_2>)
• Use face ID (e.g., <face_1>) when the detail is grounded in visual data. • Use speaker ID (e.g., <voice_1>) when the detail is grounded in speech.
• Do not use non-existent <face_ID> or <voice_ID>.
• We reiterate the above-mentioned list of available IDs here: {ID_list}
• For characters without associated feature IDs, refer to them using a concise visual or contextual descriptor (e.g., "a man in a blue shirt", "a young woman by the window").
• Do not use pronouns (e.g., "he", "she", "they") or inferred character names.

Your output should be a Python list of well-formed, concise English sentences (one detail per sentence).

Example Output: [
"In the bright conference room, <face_1> enters confidently, adjusting his black suit with a white shirt and tie. He has short black hair and wears glasses, giving a professional appearance as he approaches <face_2> to shake hands.",
"<face_2>, dressed in a striking red dress with long brown hair, smiles warmly and greets <face_1>. She then sits down at the table beside him, glancing at her phone briefly while occasionally looking up.",
"<voice_1> speaks to the group, ‘Good afternoon, everyone. Let’s begin the meeting.’ His voice commands attention as the room quiets, and all eyes turn to him.",
"<face_2> listens attentively to <voice_1>’s words, nodding in agreement while still occasionally checking her phone. The atmosphere is professional, with the participants settling into their roles for the meeting.",
"<face_1> adjusts his tie and begins discussing the agenda, engaging the participants in a productive conversation."

D.2	Entity ID Relationship Detection
There is a special type of semantic memory, extracting cross-modal identity equivalences from video. This remains a challenging task, even for advanced models like Gemini-1.5-Pro, particularly in scenes with multiple faces and voices [15].  To address this, we propose a progressive annotation algorithm.  The key idea is to identify meta-clips, segments containing exactly one face identity and one voice identity, from the raw long video.  These meta-clips are used to build a meta-dictionary that maps voice IDs to face IDs across the entire video.  This dictionary enables automatic annotation of any 30-second clip extracted from the original video.
Meta-Clip Extraction  First, for a long video, we can use facial recognition tools and voice identity tools introduced in Appendix C to construct a corresponding global ID for each face and voice that appears in the video. Next, we segment the video into a series of short clips, each no longer than 5 seconds in duration, using keyframe-based division. This method ensures that each clip is visually stable, with minimal changes in characters or scenes. Then, we apply facial recognition and voice identity tools to each short clip individually to extract the faces and voices present, along with their global IDs. If a clip contains only one face ID and one voice ID, we refer to it as a meta-clip. In this case, it is highly likely that the face and voice in the clip belong to the same person. Therefore, we can use the meta-clip as a high-confidence sample for establishing the association between faces and voices.

Meta-Dictionary Construction Based on all meta-clips extracted from the long video, we construct a set of mappings between face IDs and voice IDs. However inconsistencies may arise due to a small number of clips where the speaker is not visible.  To address this issue, we employ a voting mechanism to generate the final meta-dictionary. The detailed algorithm is described in Algorithm 2.

New-Clip Annotation After obtaining the meta-dictionary, we can use it to annotate arbitrary clips from the full-length video. Specifically, for each 30-second clip, if both a face ID and a voice ID appearing in the clip and also found in the meta-dictionary, we generate a semantic memory in the form: "Equivalence: <face_id>, <voice_id>".  Since not all IDs can be found using the meta-dictionary, we reject any clip containing a voice ID that is not present in the meta-dictionary from the final training dataset for memorization. In total, we collected 10,952 30-second clips with valid identity equivalence annotations. We manually review 48 randomly sampled mappings, and found the accuracy to be 95.83%.

D.3	Semantic Memory Synthesis
To construct semantic memory, we adopt a hybrid strategy similar to that used for episodic memory.  We define several key dimensions that semantic memory should address, as outlined in Table 10. Specifically, we first prompt GPT-4o to generate preliminary semantic memory based on video frames and episodic memory. Next, we provide the video, episodic memory, and GPT-4o-generated semantic memory to Gemini-1.5-Pro, prompting it to produce the final semantic memory. Detailed prompts are provided in Table 12.

You are provided with the following data:
[Video]: 16 frames of a video. (Gemini-1.5-Pro Variant:  A video clip in mp4 format.)
[Faces]: A list of facial features detected in the video, each linked to a unique face ID (e.g., <face_1>). [Dialogues]: A list of speech segments in the video, including start_time, end_time, speaker ID (e.g., <voice_2>), and the corresponding transcribed text.
[Video Descriptions]: A description of the video.
(Gemini-1.5-Pro Variant:  [Refence conclusions]:  A list of high-level conclusions that may contain inadequate or incorrect information.)

Your Task:

Based on the given character features, video content, and reference conclusions, generate a list of high-level, reasoning-based conclusions within the scope of the following category:

1. Character-Level Attributes
(Continued on next page)

29


Infer abstract attributes for each character, such as: • Name (if explicitly stated),
• Personality (e.g., confident, nervous),
• Role/profession (e.g., host, newcomer),
• Interests or background (when inferable),
• Distinctive behaviors or traits (e.g., speaks formally, fidgets). Avoid restating visual facts—focus on identity construction.

2. Interpersonal Relationships & Dynamics
Describe the relationships and interactions between multiple characters: • Roles (e.g., host-guest, leader-subordinate),
• Emotions or tone (e.g., respect, tension), • Power dynamics (e.g., who leads),
• Evidence of cooperation, exclusion, conflict, etc.
• For individual character or cases where character relationships cannot be determined, do not generate conclusion relevant to the corresponding character.

3. Video-Level Plot Understanding
Summarize the scene-level narrative, such as: • Main event or theme,
• Narrative arc or sequence (e.g., intro → discussion → reaction), • Overall tone (e.g., formal, tense),
• Cause-effect or group dynamics.
• Do not involve specific characters.

4. Contextual & General Knowledge
Include general knowledge that can be learned from the video, such as: • Likely setting or genre (e.g., corporate meeting, game show),
• Cultural/procedural norms,
• Real-world knowledge (e.g., "Alice market is pet-friendly"), • Common-sense or format conventions.
• Attributes and functional roles of objects in the video (e.g., the trash bin is used for disposing of kitchen waste).

Output Format:
• A Python list of concise English sentences, each expressing one high-level conclusion.
• Do not include reasoning steps or restate input observations. Only output the final conclusions.

Strict Requirements:
• Only include conclusions under the given category. Do not go beyond it. • Your conclusions must be informed by the video and reference content.
• Each conclusion should reflect deeper reasoning and insight, not surface-level observations already evident from the plot description.
• If a character has an associated feature ID in the input context (either face or voice), refer to them only using that feature ID (e.g., <face_1>, <voice_2>).
• Use face ID (e.g., <face_1>) when the detail is grounded in visual data. • Use speaker ID (e.g., <voice_1>) when the detail is grounded in speech.
• Do not use non-existent <face_ID> or <voice_ID>.
• We reiterate the above-mentioned list of available IDs here: {ID_list}
• For characters without associated feature IDs, refer to them using a concise visual or contextual descriptor (e.g., "a man in a blue shirt", "a young woman by the window").
• Do not use pronouns (e.g., "he", "she", "they") or inferred character names.
(Continued on next page)

• Maintain strict accuracy in referring to characters and their correct IDs or descriptions.
• Do not restate the input observations or reasoning steps—only output the final, distilled conclusions. • Your output should be a Python list of well-formed, concise English sentences (one per item).

Example Output (Note: example only represent the format, not fully corresponding to the provided category):
[
"<face_1>’s name is David.",
"<face_1> holds a position of authority, likely as the meeting’s organizer or a senior executive.", "<voice_2> shows social awareness and diplomacy, possibly indicating experience in public or
client-facing roles.",
"<face_1> demonstrates control and composure, suggesting a high level of professionalism and confidence under pressure.",
"The interaction between <face_1> and <voice_2> suggests a working relationship built on mutual respect.",
"The overall tone of the meeting is structured and goal-oriented, indicating it is part of a larger organizational workflow."
]

Please only return the valid string list (which starts with "[" and ends with "]") without any additional explanation or formatting.

D.4	Quality of the Synthetic Data
Although the demonstration data is synthetic, it is of high quality. Our synthetic memory averages 245.7 words for episodic memory and 276.2 words for semantic memory, compared to 151.3 and 81.4 words respectively for Gemini-1.5-pro, indicating our memory captures more detail. For content accuracy, we randomly sampled 10 clips from different videos, totaling 353 memory items. Manual review showed an accuracy of 95.5%. Most errors stemmed from the speaker recognition tool:  background noise and overlapping speech occasionally caused minor omissions or misidentifications in extracting speaker dialogue for episodic memory.

E	Evaluation of Memorization

we evaluate the memorization model during training using a held-out validation set of 200 samples and select the best checkpoint.  Two evaluation metrics are used.  First, AutoDQ [47] assesses memory description quality by comparing generated outputs to reference descriptions, measuring episodic and semantic memory excluding identity equivalence. Second, for identity equivalence, we compute precision, recall and F1 score against ground-truth in the validation set. Based on the results in Table 13, we select the checkpoint obtained after training for 3 epochs.  For additional comparison, we also report results from two baseline models, memory-gemini-prompt and memory-7b-prompt, on the same validation set.  Our model, memory-7b-sft, significantly outperforms both baselines.

Question: Is Tomasz a person with rich imagination or someone who lacks imagination? Answer: A person with rich imagination.
system     (system_prompt)
You are given a question and some relevant knowledge. Your task is to reason about whether the provided knowledge is suficient to answer the question. If it is suficient, output [Answer] followed by the answer. If it is not suficient, output [Search] and generate a query that will be encoded into embeddings for a vector similarity search.  The query will help retrieve additional information from a memory bank. Question: What is Theresa Yeap’s attitude like in her explanation of emergency services?
user     (instruction_prompt) Searched knowledge: {}
Output the answer in the format: Action: [Answer] or [Search] Content: {content}
If the answer cannot be derived yet, the {content} should be a single search query that would help retrieve the missing information. The search {content} needs to be different from the previous.
You can get the mapping relationship between character ID and name by using search query such as: "What is the name of <character_{i}>" or "What is the character id of {name}".
After obtaining the mapping, it is best to use character ID instead of name for searching.
If the answer can be derived from the provided knowledge, the {content} is the specific answer to the question. Only name can appear in the answer, not character ID like <character_{i}>.

assistant
<think>Okay, let’s see. The user is asking whether Tomasz is a person with rich imagination or someone who lacks imagination. The problem is that there’s no provided knowledge about Tomasz in the given context. The Searched knowledge is empty, so I don’t have any information to base an answer on.

First, I need to check if the existing knowledge can answer the question. Since the knowledge is empty, there’s nothing to reference. The user mentioned that if the answer can’t be derived, I should output a search query. The instructions also say to use character IDs if possible, but since we don’t know Tomasz’s ID yet, I need to find that first.
So the first step is to find the character ID for Tomasz. The user suggested using a query like "What is the character id of Tomasz" to get that mapping. Once I have the ID, I can then search for information related to his imagination. But without the ID, any search might not be effective. Therefore, the initial search should be to find the character ID. Then, using that ID, look into his traits.  Since the current knowledge is empty, the correct action is to search for the character ID first.</think>

<think>Okay, let’s see. The user wants to know if Tomasz has a rich imagination or lacks it. From the previous search, we found that Tomasz Patan is <character_4>.  Now, I need to check the provided knowledge to see if there’s any info about his imagination.
Looking through the CLIP entries for <character_4> (Tomasz Patan), the info given is about his role as Founder & CTO of Jetson, speaking in a workshop.  There’s no mention of his imagination.  Other clips mention other characters but not their traits related to imagination.  Since there’s no data here about Tomasz’s imagination, I can’t derive an answer.  The next step is to search for information on his imagination using his character ID. The query should be about his imagination, so maybe "Does <character_4> have rich imagination?" or similar. Need to make sure the query is different from previous ones. Let’s go with "What is <character_4>’s personality regarding imagination?" to retrieve relevant
info.</think> Action: [Search]

assistant
<think>Okay, let’s see. The user is asking if Tomasz is a person with rich imagination or someone who lacks imagination. So far, we’ve tried searching and couldn’t find any info about his imagination. The first step was to get his character ID, which is <character_4>. Then, we tried searching for his personality regarding imagination, but that came back empty.
Since there’s no direct information about Tomasz’s imagination in the provided knowledge, I can’t derive an answer from the existing data. The user’s instructions say that if the answer can’t be derived yet, I should generate a new search query. The previous query was about his personality regarding imagination, which didn’t yield results.  So I need to approach it from another angle.
Maybe instead of asking about his personality, I can look for any mentions of his traits in general. Perhaps there’s a clip where his characteristics are discussed, but it’s not related to imagination. Alternatively, maybe his role as a CTO or founder of a company could imply something about his creativity or innovation, which are related to imagination.  However, the knowledge provided doesn’t mention anything about his traits beyond his professional role.
Given that the knowledge is still empty, I should create a new query that’s different from the previous one. Perhaps asking about his creative abilities or how others perceive his problem-solving skills. Alternatively, checking for any quotes or statements he made that might indicate his imaginative nature.
The key is to generate a query that’s specific enough to retrieve information if it exists.   So maybe "What are <character_4>’s creative problem-solving methods?" or "How does <character_4> approach innovation in his work?" These queries might uncover information about his imagination through his work style or achievements.
Since the user wants the search query to be different from the previous ones, I’ll go with one of these alternatives. Let’s pick "What are <character_4>’s creative problem-solving methods?" to see if that yields any relevant information about his imagination.</think>

<think>Okay, let’s tackle this question. The user wants to know if Tomasz is a person with rich imagination or someone who lacks imagination. From the provided knowledge, we have a bunch of clips about Tomasz Patan (character_4). Let me go through the info again.
In CLIP_6, there’s a lot of detail about his work with drones and the Jetson aircraft.  He mentions scaling drone technology for personal flight, which shows he’s thinking beyond the current applications. The notes say he’s innovative and forward-thinking, with a hands-on approach.  He’s involved in testing and data analysis, and he’s enthusiastic about his work. The video’s tone is optimistic, highlighting his problem-solving methods and the development process.
The key points here are his background in drones, his idea to scale them into personal aircraft, and his active role in testing. The description explicitly states he’s innovative and forward-thinking. These traits are closely related to having a rich imagination.  Since he’s taking existing technology (drones) and envisioning a new application (personal flight), that requires creativity and imagination. Also, the narrative of the video presents him as someone who asks "what if" questions, which is a hallmark of imaginative thinking.
I don’t see any information suggesting he lacks imagination. All the provided details support the idea that he’s imaginative. Therefore, the answer should be that Tomasz is a person with rich imagination.</think> Action: [Answer]
Content: Tomasz is a person with rich imagination.

The prompt for GPT-4o evaluation
You are provided with a question, a ground truth answer, and an answer from an agent model. Your task is to determine whether the ground truth answer can be logically inferred from the agent’s answer, in the context of the question.

Do not directly compare the surface forms of the agent answer and the ground truth answer. Instead, assess whether the meaning expressed by the agent answer supports or implies the ground truth answer. If the ground truth can be reasonably derived from the agent answer, return "Yes". If it cannot, return "No".

Important notes:
• Do not require exact wording or matching structure.
• Semantic inference is suficient, as long as the agent answer entails or implies the meaning of the ground truth answer, given the question.
• Only return "Yes" or "No", with no additional explanation or formatting.

Input fields:
• question: the question asked
• ground_truth_answer: the correct answer
• agent_answer: the model’s answer to be evaluated

Now evaluate the following input:

Input:
• question: {question}
• ground_truth_answer: {ground_truth_answer} • agent_answer: {agent_answer}

H.2	Prompts for Socratic Models
Table 19 presents the prompt used in Socratic Models baselines. Through prompt engineering, we find that placing the question after the long context (e.g., video detailed descriptions) enhances the model’s ability to retain the question and focus on relevant information, leading to improved answer accuracy.  Accordingly, in our Socratic Models experiments, we adopt this approach by appending the question to the end of the retrieved clip descriptions during the RAG-based QA stage.

• Do not use generic descriptions, inferred names, or pronouns to refer to characters (e.g., "he," "they," "the man").
• The generated descriptions of the video clip should include every detail observable in the frames and mentioned in the audio dialogues. (GPT-4o, Qwen2.5-VL-7b Variant:  • The generated descriptions of the video clip should include every detail observable in the frames and mentioned in the audio dialogues.)
• Pay close attention to any introduction of characters’ names, titles, or other identifiers provided in the frames or audio.
• Whenever possible, include natural time expressions and physical location cues in the descriptions to improve contextual understanding. These should be based on inferred situational context (e.g., "in the evening at the dinner table," "early morning outside the building").
• Include relevant background, common knowledge and environmental factors when needed (e.g., location, weather, setting) to provide a fuller understanding of the context.
• Maintain a natural, narrative flow in the description, ensuring that it reads like a coherent summary of the events in the video.
• Remember you are looking at key frames and audio dialogue information, not the full video, so focus on what can be observed from these specific materials.

"As Margaret returns with the teapot, Tom stands up to help her pour the tea, gesturing politely as she hands him a cup. Margaret sits back down. Margaret leans forward slightly, her hands resting on the table, and after a moment of silence, she speaks again, her voice steady but filled with a hint of urgency. Tom listens closely, his brow furrowing slightly as he takes in her words. He responds quietly, nodding slowly as he processes the information."

RAG Answer Prompt (GPT-4o)
Based on the following video description, answer the question as concisely as possible. Provide only the direct answer without explanations or reasoning.

Question: {question}

Relevant Video Clip Captions: {retrived_clips}

Answer:

Table 19  The prompts for the experiments of the Socratic Models.  For models that take either raw video (gemini-1.5-pro, Qwen2.5-Omni-7b) input or video frames with ASR transcripts (GPT4o, Qwen2.5-VL-7b), the description generation prompt has minor differences, which are indicated in italicized parentheses.


H.3	Prompts for M3-Agent
Table 20 shows the prompt used by Gemini-Agent and Gemini-GPT4o-Hybrid during memorization. Table 21 shows the prompt used by Gemini-Agent and Gemini-GPT4o-Hybrid during control.

Table 22 shows the prompt used by M3-Agent during the control process. The system prompt at the beginning of each session specifies the overall task objectives.  The instruction prompt appended at the start of each round provides the question and detailed guidance.  The last-round prompt, used only in the final round, signals the agent that it is the final opportunity to respond.

Memorization Prompt ( memory-gemini-prompt, memory-7b-prompt )
You are given a video along with a set of character features. Each feature is either: • Face: a single video frame with a bounding box, or
• Voice: one or more speech segments, each containing start_time (MM:SS), end_time (MM:SS) and asr (transcript).
Every feature has a unique ID enclosed in angle brackets (e.g. <face_1>, <voice_2>).

Your Tasks (produce both in the same response) :

1. Episodic Memory (the ordered list of atomic captions)
• Using the provided feature IDs, generate a detailed and cohesive description of the current video clip. The description should capture the complete set of observable and inferable events in the clip. Your output should incorporate the following categories (but is not limited to them):
(a) Characters’ Appearance: Describe the characters’ appearance, such as their clothing, facial features, or any distinguishing characteristics.
(b) Characters’ Actions & Movements: Describe specific gesture, movement, or interaction performed by the characters.
(c) Characters’ Spoken Dialogue: Quote—or, if necessary, summarize—what are spoken by the characters.
(d) Characters’ Contextual Behavior: Describe the characters’ roles in the scene or their interaction with other characters, focusing on their behavior, emotional state, or relationships.

(Continued on next page)

43


2. Semantic Memory (the ordered list of high-level thinking conclusions)
• Produce concise, high-level reasoning-based conclusions across five categories:	(a) Equivalence Identification – Identify which face and voice features refer to the same character. Use the exact format: Equivalence: <face_x>, <voice_y>. Include as many confident matches as possible.
(b) Character-level Attributes – Infer abstract attributes for each character, such as: Name (if explicitly stated), Personality (e.g., confident, nervous), Role/profession (e.g., host, newcomer), Interests or background (when inferable), istinctive behaviors or traits (e.g., speaks formally, fidgets). Avoid restating visual facts—focus on identity construction.
(c) Interpersonal Relationships & Dynamics – Describe the relationships and interactions between characters: Roles (e.g., host-guest, leader-subordinate), Emotions or tone (e.g., respect, tension), Power dynamics (e.g., who leads), Evidence of cooperation, exclusion, conflict, etc.
(d) Video-level Plot Understanding – Summarize the scene-level narrative, such as: Main event or theme, Narrative arc or sequence (e.g., intro → discussion → reaction), Overall tone (e.g., formal, tense),
Cause-effect or group dynamics.
(e) Contextual & General Knowledge – Include general knowledge that can be learned from the video, such as: Likely setting or genre (e.g., corporate meeting, game show), Cultural/procedural norms,
Real-world knowledge (e.g., "Alice market is pet-friendly"), Common-sense or format conventions.

Strict Requirements (apply to both sections unless noted)

1. If a character has a provided feature ID, refer to that character only with the ID (e.g. <face_1>, <voice_2>).
2. If no ID exists, use a short descriptive phrase (e.g. "a man in a blue shirt"). 3. Do not use "he," "she," "they," pronouns, or invented Names.
4. Keep face/voice IDs consistent throughout.
5. Describe only what is grounded in the video or obviously inferable.
6. Include natural Time & Location cues and setting hints when inferable.
7. Each Episodic Memory line must express one event/detail; split sentences if needed. 8. Output English only.
9. Output a Python list of sentences for each memory type.

Additional Rules for Episodic Memory

1. Do not mix unrelated aspects in one memory sentence.
2. Focus on appearance, actions/movements, spoken dialogue (quote or summary), contextual behavior.

Additional Rules for Semantic Memory

1. For Equivalence lines, use the exact format: Equivalence: <face_x>, <voice_y>. 2. Do not repeat simple surface observations already in the captions.
3. Provide only final conclusions, not reasoning steps.

Expected Output Format

Return the result as a single Python dict containing exactly two keys:

{
"episodic_memory": [
"In the bright conference room, <face_1> enters confidently, giving a professional appearance as he approaches <face_2> to shake hands.",
"<face_1> wears a black suit with a white shirt and tie. He has short black hair and wears glasses.", "<face_2>, dressed in a striking red dress with long brown hair.",
(Continued on next page)

"<face_2> smiles warmly and greets <face_1>. She then sits down at the table beside him, glancing at her phone briefly while occasionally looking up.",
"<voice_1> speaks to the group, ’Good afternoon, everyone. Let’s begin the meeting.’ His voice commands attention as the room quiets, and all eyes turn to him.",
"<face_2> listens attentively to <voice_1>’s words, nodding in agreement while still occasionally checking her phone. The atmosphere is professional, with the participants settling into their roles for the meeting.",
"<face_1> adjusts his tie and begins discussing the agenda, engaging the participants in a productive conversation."
], "semantic_memory": [
"Equivalence: <face_1>, <voice_1>", "<face_1>’s name is David.",
"<face_1> holds a position of authority, likely as the meeting’s organizer or a senior executive.", "<face_2> shows social awareness and diplomacy, possibly indicating experience in public or
client-facing roles.",
"<face_1> demonstrates control and composure, suggesting a high level of professionalism and confidence under pressure.",
"The interaction between <face_1> and <face_2> suggests a working relationship built on mutual respect.",
"The overall tone of the meeting is structured and goal-oriented, indicating it is part of a larger organizational workflow."
] }

Please only return the valid python dict (which starts with "{" and ends with "}") containing two string lists in "episodic_memory" and "semantic_memory", without any additional explanation or formatting.

Control Prompt
You are given a question and some relevant knowledge about a specific video. You are also provided with a retrieval plan, which outlines the types of information that should be retrieved from a memory bank in order to answer the question. Your task is to reason about whether the provided knowledge is suficient to answer the question. If it is suficient, output [ANSWER] followed by the answer. If it is not suficient, output [SEARCH] and generate a query that will be encoded into embeddings for a vector similarity search. The query will help retrieve additional information from a memory bank that contains detailed descriptions and high-level abstractions of the video, considering the question, the provided knowledge, and the retrieval plan.

Your response should contain two parts: 1. Reasoning
• Analyze the question, the knowledge, and the retrieval plan.
• If the current information is suficient, explain why and what conclusions you can draw. • If not, clearly identify what is missing and why it is important.
2. Answer or Search
• [ANSWER]: If the answer can be derived from the provided knowledge, output [ANSWER] followed by a short, clear, and direct answer.
• When referring to a character, always use their specific name if available. • Do not use ID tags like <character_{1}> or <face_{1}>.
(Continued on next page)


45


• [SEARCH]: If the answer cannot be derived yet, output [SEARCH] followed by a single search query that would help retrieve the missing information.

Instructions for [SEARCH] queries:
• Use the retrieval plan to inform what type of content should be searched for next. These contents should cover aspects that provide useful context or background to the question, such as character names, behaviors, relationships, personality traits, actions, and key events.
• Use keyword-based queries, not command sentences. Queries should be written as compact keyword phrases, not as full sentences or instructions. Avoid using directive language like "Retrieve", "Describe", or question forms such as "What", "When", "How".
• Keep each query short and focused on one point. Each query should target one specific type of information, without combining multiple ideas or aspects.
• Avoid over-complexity and unnecessary detail. Do not include too many qualifiers or conditions. Strip down to the most essential keywords needed to retrieve valuable content.
• The query should target information outside of the existing knowledge that might help answer the question.
• For time-sensitive or chronological information (e.g., events occurring in sequence, changes over time, or specific moments in a timeline), you can generate clip-based queries that reference specific clips or moments in time. These queries should include a reference to the clip number, indicating the index of the clip in the video (a number from 1 to N, where a smaller number indicates an earlier clip). Format these queries as "CLIP_x", where x should be an integer that indicates the clip index. Note only generate
clip-based queries if the question is about a specific moment in time or a sequence of events.
• You can also generate queries that focus on specific characters or characters’ attributes using the id shown in the knowledge.
• Make sure your generated query focus on some aspects that are not retrieved or asked yet. Do not repeatedly generate queries that have high semantic similarity with those generated before.

Example 1:

Input:

Question: How did the argument between Alice and Bob influence their relationship in the story?

Knowledge: [
{{
"query": "What happened during the argument between Alice and Bob?", "related memories": {{
"CLIP_2": [
"<face_1> and <face_2> are seen arguing in the living room." "<face_1> raises her voice, and <face_2> looks upset." "<face_1> accuses <face_2> of not listening to her."
], }}
}} ]

Output:

It seems that <face_1> and <face_2> are arguing about their relationship. I need to figure out the names of <face_1> and <face_2>.
[SEARCH] What are the names of <face_1> and <face_2>?
(Continued on next page)

46



Example 2:

Input:

Question: How did the argument between Alice and Bob influence their relationship in the story?

Knowledge: [
{{
"query": "What happened during the argument between Alice and Bob?", "related memories": {{
"CLIP_2": [
"<face_1> and <face_2> are seen arguing in the living room." "<face_1> raises her voice, and <face_2> looks upset." "<face_1> accuses <face_2> of not listening to her."
], }}
}}, {{
"query": "What are the names of <face_1> and <face_2>?", "related memories": {{
"CLIP_1": [
"<face_1> says to <face_2>: ‘I am done with you Bob!’"", "<face_2> says to <face_1>: ‘What about now, Alice?’""
], }}
}} ]

Output:

It seems that content in CLIP_2 shows exactly the argument between Alice and Bob. To figure out how did the argument between Alice and Bob influence their relationship, I need to see what happened next in CLIP_3.
[SEARCH] What happened in CLIP_3?

Now, generate your response for the following input:

Question: {question}

Knowledge: {search_results}

Output:

Control Prompt (last round)
You are given a question about a specific video and a dictionary of some related information about the video. Each key in the dictionary is a clip ID (an integer), representing the index of a video clip. The corresponding value is a list of video descriptions from that clip.

Your task is to analyze the provided information, reason over it, and produce the most reasonable and well-supported answer to the question.
(Continued on next page)

47



Output Requirements:
• Your response must begin with a brief reasoning process that explains how you arrive at the answer. • Then, output [ANSWER] followed by your final answer.
• The format must be: Here is the reasoning... [ANSWER] Your final answer here.
• Your final answer must be definite and specific — even if the information is partial or ambiguous, you must infer and provide the most reasonable answer based on the given evidence.
• Do not refuse to answer or say that the answer is unknowable. Use reasoning to reach the best possible conclusion.

Additional Guidelines:
• When referring to a character, always use their specific name if it appears in the video information. • Do not use placeholder tags like <character_1> or <face_1>.
• Avoid summarizing or repeating the video information. Focus on reasoning and answering. • The final answer should be short, clear, and directly address the question.

Input:
• Question: {question}
• Video Information: {search_results}

Output:

Table 21  Control prompt for Gemini-Agent and Gemini-GPT4o-Hybrid.


system_prompt
You are given a question and some relevant knowledge. Your task is to reason about whether the provided knowledge is suficient to answer the question. If it is suficient, output [Answer] followed by the answer. If it is not suficient, output [Search] and generate a query that will be encoded into embeddings for a vector similarity search. The query will help retrieve additional information from a memory bank.

Question: instruction_prompt
Output the answer in the format: Action: [Answer] or [Search] Content: {content}

If the answer cannot be derived yet, the {content} should be a single search query that would help retrieve the missing information. The search {content} needs to be different from the previous.
You can get the mapping relationship between character ID and name by using search query such as: "What is the name of <character_{i}>" or "What is the character id of {name}".
After obtaining the mapping, it is best to use character ID instead of name for searching.
If the answer can be derived from the provided knowledge, the {content} is the specific answer to the question. Only name can appear in the answer, not character ID like <character_{i}>.
last_round_prompt
The Action of this round must be [Answer]. If there is insuficient information, you can make reasonable guesses.
